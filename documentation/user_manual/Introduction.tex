\section{Introduction}
This instruction will provide the basic information about how to use ``ConservAtion Laws Model", called CALM, as a non programmer user. For more specific information please take a look to the ``CALM - documentation" file, where you can find how to modify CALM source code to make simulation more suitable for your experiment.
This user guide was written by Filip Skóra as an attachment for his engineering thesis conducted by Dr Engineer Małgorzata Janik. The user guide was subsequently updated by Bartosz Woźnica for CALM version 1.2 during the writing of his engineering thesis.\\

CALM was developed by Anna Zaborowska, Małgorzata Janik, Filip Skóra, Daniel Rodak and Bartosz Woźnica based on the TERMINATOR \cite{terminator} event generator.
