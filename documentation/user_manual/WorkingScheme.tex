\section{CALM - working scheme}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item INITIALIZATION: Reading configuration from .ini files
    \item Creating event
    \item Generating multiplicity for event
    \item Generating types for particles; event must obey conservation laws.
    \item Generating direction of movement for each particle
    \item Generating total energy of collision
    \item Dividing total energy between all particles
    \item Generating event; filtering the most unlikely events
    \item Saving event to the file
    \item POST ACTION: After doing steps 2-9 10000 times, CALM closes the file.
\end{enumerate}
