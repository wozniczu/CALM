\section{CALM options}
\label{sec:CALMoptions}
CALM has six options of simulation. We can distinguish them into two types:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item GENBOD -- program uses CERN Root library Genbod which is used to make similar simulations
    \item REGGAE\cite{Meres:2011ek} -- REscatterig-after-Genbod GenerAtor of Events, more effective type of simulation, easier but much faster
\end{enumerate}
Each of them has three types of influence on outgoing particles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Global -- simple proton-proton collision (no influence)
    \item MinijetsGlobal -- split particles into two jets and boosts them in opposite directions
    \item MinijetsLocal -- same as above but here CALM will check conservation laws for each jet separately 
\end{itemize}
